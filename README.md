# 🐍 Python Week 2 Assignment

This is my submission for **Week 2** of the Software Development 2025 python Module course. The focus of this assignment was to practice Python list operations and become comfortable with key list manipulation methods.

## ✅ Assignment Summary

The assignment walks through these steps using a list:

1. Initialize an empty list
2. Append values: 5, 10, 20, 30, 40
3. Insert the value `15` at the second position
4. Extend the list with `[50, 60, 70]`
5. Remove the last element
6. Sort the list in ascending order
7. Find and print the index of the value `30`

### 📄 File
